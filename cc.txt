Hi Arti,

As part of today's activity, I talked to all the ladies and below is the conclusion what I felt or understood about them all is as below ..

Meha : She is clear, smart and open minded. She knows what she wants and after this long gap just finding a way to achieve/get it.
             She is teaching Maths in her society to kids as she likes to do that and keep herself engaged. After her first child she went to abroad
             for higher studies but could not make use of it at that time because after coming back she conceived her second baby and become
            busy with kids and family.

Sukanya : She is a smart and confident lady. She likes to do cooking and gardening. She left her job as she could not cop up with kids, family
                  and work culture of her company but now her kids are grown up so she wants to do something for herself too.

Shilpa : I felt she is a bit shy. after her collage she worked for a company for a year and after that got married. Her husband job demands
               relocations so she could not try for a job. She likes traveling.

Vaibhavi: She worked for many companies in manual testing and in future she wants to go for automation testing. She likes traveling and
                  cooking. Today when I called her, she was making pulao ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

Rajeswari: She had 7 years of experience as main frame developer, after her son born, she left her job. she frankly told that she did nothing
                   other than taking care of family and kid

These are the inputs I received from them ðŸ™‚

Thank You!
Regards
Madhavi
